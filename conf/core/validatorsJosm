# Configuration file containing a line delimited list of JOSM validator Java class names without
# namespace prefixes or file extensions (e.g. 'DuplicatedWayNodes') to use during validation or
# cleaning. This is configured within Hootenanny rather than loaded from the JOSM configuration due 
# to the fact the auto-instantiation of validators by OsmValidator can cause the JVM to hang. With 
# each JOSM upgrade a check needs to be made for new available validators by looking at the 
# hardcoded list in the OsmValidator::CORE_TEST_CLASSES member variable and this file updated 
# accordingly.
#
# Note: We're currently explicitly skipping the following due to current lack of support in 
# hoot-josm for security certificates:
#
# ApiCapabilitiesTest
# MapCssTagCheckerTest
#
# All others (and MapCssTagCheckerTest) are commented out due to bug in #4951.
