# Configuration file containing a line delimited list of JOSM validator Java class names without
# namespace prefixes or file extensions (e.g. 'DuplicatedWayNodes') to use during validation or
# cleaning. This is configured within Hootenanny rather than loaded from the JOSM configuration due 
# to the fact the auto-instantiation of some validators by OsmValidator can cause the JVM to hang at 
# shutdown. This config file also allows us to tailor the validators for use with hoot. With each 
# JOSM upgrade a check needs to be made for new available validators by looking at the hardcoded 
# list in the OsmValidator::CORE_TEST_CLASSES member variable and this file updated accordingly.
